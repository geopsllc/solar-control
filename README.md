## General
This is a Streamlined CLI-Based Core v4 Management Tool. 
- Installs fail2ban for ssh, and ufw allowing only ssh and the cores ports.
- For start/restart/stop/status/logs you can skip the 'all' argument as it's the default.
- For install/reinstall you can skip the 'core' argument as it's the default.
- For update you can skip the 'check' argument as it's the default.
- For system you can skip the 'info' argument as it's the default.
- Using the 'restart safe' arguments requires the round-monitor core plugin and restarts the core services when safe to do so in 
order to avoid missing a block.
- When setting a delegate secret just type your secret after the 'set' argument without quotes.
- When doing a rollback just type the desired height after the 'rollback' argument.
- Rollback will stop the running processes, do the rollback and start the processes that were online.
- The script adds an alias named 'ccontrol' on first run. On your next shell login you'll be able to call the script from anywhere
using: ccontrol arg1 [arg2]. It also has autocomplete functionality for all possible arguments.
- Using the 'config reset' arguments will stop the core processes, delete your existing configs and replace them with the defaults.
If you're running a forger and/or have custom settings, you should add them again.
- On first run the tool exposes the core-cli with the project name, e.g. ark for project Ark. It will be accessible after logout.
- Do not run as root!
